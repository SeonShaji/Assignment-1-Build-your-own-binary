# IMGD 5010 Assignment 1 Build your own binary : **TRIANGLES 101**

The triangle is the universal language of the GPU. Because it is the simplest shape to calculate, it forms the essential geometry for everything we render, from low-poly sprites to vast, cinematic environments.

I've developed a simple protocol that uses binary numbers from 1-bit to 4-bits that serves as instructions to manipulate a single triangle to create complex shapes through iteration.

## 1 - Creating the initial triangle
```
00 - Isosceles Triangle
01 - Scalene Triangle (long right side)
10 - Scalene Triangle (long left side)
11 - Equilateral Triangle
```

We're ignoring the lengths of the sides of the triangle, since it only affects the size of the final shape.

## 2 - Defining the angle
```
X      X      X      X
90°    60°    30°    15°
```

Each bit represent the corresponding value in degrees.

Examples of commonly used angles:
```
30°  - 0001
45°  - 0011
60°  - 0100
90°  - 1000
120° - 1010
135° - 1011
180° - 1110
```

The above command can be used as follows:
1. To define the top angle of the triangle
2. To rotate the initial triangle (Anti-clockwise direction)

The following commands initializes a 60 ° isosceles triangle and rotates it 90 °.

```
00   (Isosceles Triangle)
0100 (Angle 60°)
1000 (Rotation 90°)
```

## 3 - Manipulating the triangle
```
100 - Flip Left Once
010 - Flip Down Once
001 - Flip Right Once

110 - Flip Left and Loop
011 - Flip Right and Loop
111 - Flip Down and Loop
```

The above commands takes the initial triangle(or the last duplicated triangle) creates a copy and flips it along the given side. 

Note: Because triangles can be rotated or flipped, 'left' and 'right' become relative. To reduce the complexity we can choose the side that most closely aligns with a cardinal direction (Up, Down, Left, or Right), ensuring predictable transformations regardless of the triangle's current rotation.

The loop operations repeats the above process until it collides with another triangle. This process could produce an endless cycle based on the setup of the initial triangle.

## Examples
### Square
```
00   (Isosceles Triangle)
1000 (Angle 90°)
0011 (Rotation 45°)
010/001  (Flip Down / Flip Right) 
```

### Circle
```
00   (Isosceles Triangle)
0001 (Angle 15°)
0000 (Rotation 0°)
