Very cool. I tried the cat/fox one. I think 
```
11 Equilateral Triangle
0001 Rotate 30 deg
010 - Flip Down Once
010 - Flip Down Once
010 - Flip Down Once

001 - Flip Right Once

000 - Flip Up Once
000 - Flip Up Once
000 - Flip Up Once
```
should give me this . The puzzles are pretty fun. I had to look at the hint for the dumbbell. The hints are really helpful as are all the examples. The circle and the starburst are very clever. I like the use of the while loop in the binary for what causes the patterning to stop on intersection. I could see this being a fun puzzle in a game. Edit: I can see that my cat answer is different than the one in the hint, but I think it should still be valid
